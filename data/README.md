This folder contains the CSV files obtained from the accelerometer measurements.
The results were produced from two independent repetitions.
Each repetition includes recordings from both the ankle and the wrist, for which three successive series were performed.
Thus, for the first repetition and the first series of the ankle measurement, the file is named cheville_serie1_essai1 (ankle_series1_trial1).

This README file contains the CSV files obtained from the measurements carried out with the accelerometer.
